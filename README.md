  - [gcov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html) is a utility which is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) suite and which allows to generate the exact number of times that the instructions of a program have been executed.

  - CMake, that no longer needs presentation especially in the world of open source, will be the build system tool that we will use.
