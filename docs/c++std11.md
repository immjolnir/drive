##  C++11 initializer list syntax


## std::forward_list

`std::forward_list` is a container that supports fast insertion and removal of elements from anywhere in the container. Fast random access is not supported. It is implemented as a singly-linked list. Compared to `std::list` this container provides more space efficient storage when bidirectional iteration is not needed.

- Example: modules/basis/iterator/iterator_category.cpp
