## [from_range](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges/from_range)

std::from_range is a disambiguation tag that can be passed to the constructors of the suitable containers to indicate that the contained member is range constructed.

The corresponding type std::from_range_t can be used in the constructor's parameter list to match the intended tag.
