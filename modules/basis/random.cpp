    srand(time(NULL));

Note that you will likely receive a similar warning for your call to `srand()` â€“ the time_t value returned by the time()
call is most often a signed type (though this isn't explicitly mentioned by the Standard, IIRC) but srand expects an
unsigned argument.

Further, as you're using C++, you should consider replacing your use of rand() with the far more versatile functions
provided by the STL, in the <random> header. With these, you can dispense with the need for the % 3 operation (by
specifying a range of 0 thru 2 to the generator) and also avoid the need for a cast (by specifying an unsigned type for
that generator).
