# [Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature descriptor](https://learnopencv.com/histogram-of-oriented-gradients/)

A lot many things look difficult and mysterious. But once you take the time to deconstruct them, the mystery is
replaced by mastery and that is what we are after. If you are a beginner and are finding Computer Vision hard and
mysterious, just remember the following

A : One bite at a time!


In the HOG feature descriptor, the distribution ( histograms ) of directions of gradients ( oriented gradients ) are
used as features. Gradients ( x and y derivatives ) of an image are useful because the magnitude of gradients is large
around edges and corners ( regions of abrupt intensity changes ) and we know that edges and corners pack in a lot more
information about object shape than flat regions.
